### 1 - React
#### What is React.js?
React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. In simple terms, it helps developers create interactive and dynamic elements on websites.
#### Key features
- **Component-Based**: React lets you build UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable pieces called components.
- **Declarative Syntax**: With React, you describe how your UI should look at any given point in time, and React takes care of updating the actual UI to match this description. It's like telling React what you want, and React figures out how to make it happen.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM (the structure of your web page) to keep track of changes. When there's a change in your data or UI, React first updates this virtual DOM, then efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM. It's like having a blueprint of your web page that React can quickly modify without needing to rebuild everything from scratch.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly in your JavaScript files. It's like mixing HTML with JavaScript, which makes it easier to create and visualize UI components in React.
